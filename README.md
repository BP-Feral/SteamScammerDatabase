# Scammer Reports — Responsible Community Project

> Community-maintained, evidence-first collection of reported Steam scam *incidents* intended for education, research, and building tools to protect users — **not** a public shaming or doxxing list.

## Purpose
This repository collects **sanitized, evidence-backed reports** of scam attempts observed on Steam. The twin goals are to:

1. Help the community recognize scam patterns and trends (education).
2. Provide a responsibly-maintained, privacy-conscious dataset that developers and researchers may use to build defensive tools (blocklists, browser extensions, detection heuristics).

**This is NOT a project for publishing unverified accusations or personal data.**

## Allowed uses
You are welcome to:

- Contribute structured, evidence-backed reports according to the contributor guidelines.
- Use **sanitized** dataset to build defensive tools: browser extensions, filters, detection algorithms, or educational resources.
- Reuse aggregated, anonymized statistics (patterns by technique, common scam URLs, timelines) for research or public awareness.

You **may not** use the repository to harass, intimidate, or publicly shame individuals. Do not publish raw PII or encourage vigilantism.

## Verification & evidence standards
To minimize false positives and legal risk, every entry must meet the following minimum standard - at least one verifiable piece of evidence (screenshot, chat log, or scam URL).

## Legal & safety notice
- This project is **not** law enforcement. We do not investigate or enforce punishments.
- We are not responsible for how third parties use any data derived from this repository.
- Hosting and publishing allegations about people can create legal exposure. Maintain strict evidence and verification standards and consult legal counsel before making information public.
- If you believe you are the target of a scam, report it to Valve/Steam Support and your local law enforcement as appropriate.

## Code of conduct
Be civil and evidence-focused. Harassment, doxxing, slander, or threats are strictly prohibited. Violations may result in removal of contributions and banning from the project.
